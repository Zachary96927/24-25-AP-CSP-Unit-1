# Reasons for numbers in this file:
# Marcus' fav number is 11, thus why it is in this example
# Gio's high number was 852

# Write a while loop that counts up to as close, but not over,
# 852 by 11's.

while total + increment < goal:
    # Add to my total
    total += increment

# Tell the user the final number
